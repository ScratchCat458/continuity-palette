Continuity is a palette designed to be a vibrant colour set for syntax
highlighting and presentation purposes.
Continuity is composed of two systems, the first used for general
apllications with all values fully defined and the other being an
extension of this to support all tones.

If you use Continuity in your project, you can add the project badge to your README:
