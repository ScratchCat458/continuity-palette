        <h1>Vibrant for a purpose...</h1>
        <p>
          Continuity is a palette designed to be a vibrant colour set for syntax
          highlighting and presentation purposes. This inspiration comes from
          the colour choices of
          <a href="https://github.com/FreyaHolmer">Freya Holm√©r</a>, though I
          didn't end up sampling any of them during the creation process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Continuity is composed of two systems, the first used for general
          apllications with all values fully defined and the other being an
          extension of this to support all tones.
        </p>

        <h2>Standard Palette</h2>
        <p>
          The standard palette conists of 8 accents, a background and foreground
          colour and 2 shades of white for text content. Primarily, the accents
          that should be used are purple, cyan, green and pink. The other accent
          colours exist to complete the set, with blue using the same hue as the
          background colour.
        </p>

        <p>
          The accent colours all have a saturation of 80% which makes them
          <b>pop</b> against the darker background. White is the standard colour
          which should be used for text due to the contrast, however the variant
          can be used for text that should be less visible, such as the links at
          the top of this page. Foreground should only be used on top of or
          adjacent to Background, rather than in isolation.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Extended Spectra</h2>
        <p>
          The following graphic presented below demonstrates how the standard
          palette can be applied to the wider tone spectrum. Ticks marks are
          displayed on colours in the standard palette.

            alt="Full Spectra Transposed"
            id="spectra"
          />
        </div>

        <h2>Implementations</h2>
        <p>
          So far the only implementations are stylesheets for web applications.
          In future, the plan is to intergrate support for art software, syntax
          highlighting theme and other UI platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          If one of these isn't implemented yet or there is a platform that you
          would like support for, write it yourself and file a pull request.
